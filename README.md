# IPTV-Channels

Our collection of public IPTV Channels that can be accessed from across the world!

IPTV also known as Internet Protocol Television. IPTV sends shows and movies through your internet connection. The minimum speed required for IPTV is 10Mbps and 2Mbps for uploading. But, if you don't want lag while watching IPTV, you must have an internet connection that can offer over 10Mpbs speeds.

These IPTV channels come from Roku, Stirr and many other well-known websites. All of the iptv channels on this list are all active and HD (720p) or FHD (1080p).
